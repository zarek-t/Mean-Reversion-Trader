# Mean-Reversion-Trader
Buying low and selling high.
This bot implements a basic mean reversion trading strategy, automatically buying stocks when they drop below a statistically significant threshold and selling them when they rise above it.

The goal is to exploit the natural tendency of stock prices to revert to their historical mean over time. It uses historical price data, moving averages, and Z-scores to identify entry and exit points.

Perfect as a foundation for more advanced strategies or backtesting experiments.
